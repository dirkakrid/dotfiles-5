.bashrc and .bashrc.d
---------------------
.bashrc has been split out into a number of directories under .bashrc.d and gets executed in the following order

 * General pre-scripts:  All executable scripts under .bashrc.d/pre/*.bash (sorted alphabetically)
 * OS Specific scripts: The script under .bashrc.d/os/$OSNAME.bash where OSNAME is equal to the lower case version of `uname`
 * Host Specific scripts" The script under .bashrc.d/host/$HOSTNAME.bash where HOSTNAME is equal to the lower case version of `hostname -s`
 * General post-scripts: All executable scripts under .bashrc.d/post/*.bash (sorted alphabetically)

vim
---
Vim curently uses pathogen and submodules for all plugins. This means you must init all the submodules after cloning

    git submodule foreach git submodule init
    git submodule foreach git submodule update

To update the submodules/plugins:

    git submodule foreach git pull
